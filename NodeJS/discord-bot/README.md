# Discord-Bot

This is a bot for my own Discord Server.
You can join the [Domi-Dev Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ATBarFq7Va "Domi-Dev Discord Server") here.

To use this code u have to install NodeJS and Discord.js

***

There is one file missing. This is the config.json.

* You get the "token" from the discord developer site.
* The Prefix is what makes your command a command.
* The read the rules Token is just a token I wrote (with instruction on how you use it) in the Rules part of the Server. So you will have to read the rules to get the Token.
