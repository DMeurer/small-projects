# The Turtle module of python

I made many different files but this is all a trial and error of learning python.

Therefore this counts as one Project


___
# dots.py

I made this one to learn how for loops works

___
# Mandal.py

I just played around with some variables and got this. I thought this looks cool.

___
# spiral.py

It looks like rotated squares but its just squares with an angle of 91Â°

___
# star.py

Drawing a star with simple lines and angles.

___
# sun.py

tried the fill command for the first time.
