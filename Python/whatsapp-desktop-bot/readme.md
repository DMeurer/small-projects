# bot for the Whatsapp desktop app.

How it works:
* It checks a specific pixel to turn green. This is a pixel of the green notification bot.
* To make sure that the same chat is always checked, use Whatsapp's pinn option.
* When this pixel turns green because you get a message, the bot clicks until it can write in the text field.
* Now the message is typed.
* All of this in a loop what is active as long "c" is not pressed. => Press c to close the bot.
