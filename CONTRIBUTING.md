## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report.

 Fill out [the required template](https://github.com/DMeurer/small-projects/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined which repository your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in [the template](https://github.com/DMeurer/small-projects/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started the script, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead.**
* **Include screenshots, videos and error messages if possible** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Can you reproduce the problem?**
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for a project or script, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion.

Please check if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Please provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.

### Code Contribution

We try to keep programs and scripts as simple and understandable as possible. So if want to do the same as somebody else in a different way, please create a new file.

If you want to add comments or more documentary to a something you can edit the existing file.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Add new small projects
- Add comments or documentary to projects
- Fix problems
- Edit a existing project **in a new file**

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

- choose a descriptive title
- description what your code should do
- if you made a new script, add your project-name to the projects.json
- if you coded this because of an issue, please add the issue number
