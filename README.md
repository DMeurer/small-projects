Just a few small programs to learn how to code.
for example:

- [A sudoku board generator and solver](https://github.com/DMeurer/small-projects/tree/main/Python/Sudoku)
- [A Discord bot for my own server](https://github.com/DMeurer/small-projects/tree/main/NodeJS/discord-bot)
- [Some Turtle drawings from my early days of learning the python](https://github.com/DMeurer/small-projects/tree/main/Python/turtle-drawing)

## Feel free to contribute everything

Create a pull request if you got a small beginner-level script.

Every script you add makes life easier for beginners.

This can help beginners to get some ideas of what is possible to do even if they don't have much experience.

Additionally this gives them possible solution with a good documentation and much comments. This will help beginners to find they own solution.

You can create a pull request for spelling mistakes too. I am sure that I made a few misspellings as English is not my mother tongue.

But make sure you followed the [contributing guideline](https://github.com/DMeurer/small-projects/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
