# small-projects

![Python minimum version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Projects-4-brightgreen)

Just a few small programs to learn how to code.
for example:

- [A sudoku board generator and solver](https://github.com/DMeurer/small-projects/tree/main/Python/Sudoku)
- [A Discord bot for my own server](https://github.com/DMeurer/small-projects/tree/main/NodeJS/discord-bot)
